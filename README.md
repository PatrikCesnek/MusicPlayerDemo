<h2>Hello there! I'm Patrik and this is my Music Player demo app! ðŸš€</h2>
Version of the app with all basic requirements met

For Projects such as this I prefer MVVM for readability and ease of use. 

I put most of strings into Constants.swift file for safety and if the string needed to be changed it's easier to just change it in one place. :)

For now I'm still working on optional requiremetns, but I wanted to be sure everything is here in case I get stuck on something. :)
